## Project description

This is a new and updated course registration system for the University of Calgary that aims to make the overall system more intuitive. In our system, we kept it similar to the current one to ensure that students would not have to learn a completely new system from what they are used to. Our main goals were to make the system more visually pleasing as well as making features in the current system more obvious so students are able to navigate it better. Another thing we considered was integrating the academic requirements into the system as much as possible.
